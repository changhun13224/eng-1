"A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling in manual mode at the intersection of McAllister Street and Larkin Street in San Francisco when it was involved in a collision. The Waymo AV was initially traveling eastbound on McAllister Street in autonomous mode, approaching the intersection at Larkin Street. When the Waymo AV reached the near-side crosswalk in the dedicated left turn lane, it came to a complete stop at the red traffic light. When the traffic light turned green, the Waymo AV moved forward slightly, partially entering the crosswalk, to begin staging for the turn, yielding to oncoming traffic and other road users. While waiting for an adequate clearance in traffic, the traffic light turned yellow. The Waymo AV remained stopped, declining to proceed into the intersection and make the left turn. While the AV was still stopped, the test driver took over manual control and proceeded to make the left turn. About 4 seconds later, the manually driven Waymo AV made contact with an individual riding a motorized scooter who had entered the crosswalk from the sidewalk at about 10 MPH against both vehicle and pedestrian traffic signals. The motorized scooter was traveling about 6 MPH and the Waymo AV was traveling about 7 MPH at the time of contact. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its front license plate. The individual on the motorized scooter appeared to have sustained unknown soft tissue injuries, but left the scene independently."
"A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling in manual mode westbound on Euclid Avenue in San Francisco when it was involved in a collision.

"A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling in manual mode southbound on Jones Street at Ellis Street in San Francisco when a cyclist fell while passing between the Waymo AV and another vehicle. The Waymo AV test driver was traveling approximately 15 MPH and then gradually slowed and came to a stop for a passenger vehicle in its lane making a right turn onto Ellis Street. A cyclist following the Waymo AV at approximately 19 MPH then attempted to pass the Waymo AV on the left side and travel between the Waymo AV’s driver’s side and a faster-moving passenger vehicle in the left adjacent lane. As the cyclist attempted to overtake the Waymo AV and was in turn being overtaken by the adjacent passenger vehicle, the cyclist fell between the two vehicles. As the bicycle was falling, the bicycle’s front tire appears to have made contact with the rear driver’s side wheel of the Waymo AV, and the cyclist appears to have made contact with the side of the other passenger vehicle in the left adjacent lane. The Waymo AV sustained no damage. The passenger vehicle did not stop and left the scene. The cyclist was transported from the scene and reportedly treated for potential head injuries."
